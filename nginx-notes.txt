1) Install Nginx
----------------

On OSX:

brew install nginx

Docroot is: /usr/local/var/www

The default port has been set in /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf to 8080 so that
nginx can run without sudo.

nginx will load all files in /usr/local/etc/nginx/servers/.

To have launchd start nginx now and restart at login:
  brew services start nginx
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  nginx


2) Install config file
----------------------

Copy config into /usr/local/etc/nginx/servers directory:

cp cell-json-api-nginx.conf /usr/local/etc/nginx/servers/cell-json-api-nginx.conf 


3) Reload Nginx
---------------

nginx -s reload
